# fontbase-flatpak
Repackages the [AppImage] for the [FontBase] font management application as a [Flatpak], because I wanted to use FontBase on my immutable [Bluefin]-based system.
Inspired by [tinywrkb/flatpaks] and based on the [andyholmes/flatter] GitHub action and [flatpak-builder].

Not tested in any meaningful way except for "works on my machine", so use at your own discretion.
